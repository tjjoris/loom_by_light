/**
*this sketch is intended to load a bitmap from an sd card and display each row of the bitmap's pixels in a 
*addressable light strip. each pixel is converted into one of two values, because the purpose of this is
for a custom loom, which allows the user to manually choose which of 2 colours to use on each loom heddle, 
*thereby creating custom 2d loom images based off a bitmap.
*The program is written by Luke Johnson, commissioned by Elizabeth Johnson, the organizer of the project.
*some of the code was modified after being taken from bitsnbytes.co.uk:
